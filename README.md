# DA2 Assigment 2
This repository contains my work for the second assignment for the ECBS5142 - Data Analysis 2 course at CEU.

# Goal
My goal was to understand how different variables affected the Revenue per attendant of shows on Braodway in New York City.

# Data
My data comes from the from the CORGIS Dataset Project and was originally published by the Broadway League.

# Outcome

Overall, this project demonstrates that all four exploratory variables (Occupancy percentage of the theater, Percentage of potential profit, the total Number of performances, and the Show type) have some impact on Revenue per attendant. It can be said with confidence that overall Musicals have a higher Revenue per attendant than Plays, and potentially Specials. Further, larger occupancy and larger percentage of potential revenue reached, generally lead to higher Revenue per attendant. The Number of shows has a small affect on the dependent variable. However, since the model only covers approximately 40% of the observations, this is not conclusive, since there are many observations that cannot be explained by this model.
